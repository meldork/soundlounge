    <p class="desc">Hello Clay! This is the baby stage of the site, and there aren't too many moving parts, except for the posts. However. I might be thinking of using another way of going about this, because wanting to make a site is all fine and dandy, but I don't know if I really should keep it as a hard-html site. It's an option, and I wouldn't have an issue doing it, but I'd rather streamline. I'm also learning as I go, so sorry if there are any mistakes or stuff like that. Evan seems serious about this project, so I'm not worried about him bailing on me. So please, if you would, share your web dev wizard knowlege with me. <br></br> There's a lot of filler right now; Evan hasn't shared many details with me as far as the about page, cast descriptions, etc. </p>
